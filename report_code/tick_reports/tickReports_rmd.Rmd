# Project overview
We sampled 16 forested properties across Philadelphia, Delaware, and Chester counties in southeastern Pennsylvania from May to November 2019. We collected ticks at all 16 of these properties, and deployed trail cameras to photograph wildlife at 10 properties. We sampled __`r numSites`__ of your properties. We sampled ticks at the following properties: __`r listTickSites`__.
```{r message, fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results='asis'}
## since we did not do camera trapping at each site, use an ifelse() to decide what gets printed in this section

## using cat() within an Rmd chunk allows you to print whatever you want like normal text, including using headers (#) and formatting (**x**)


if(i %in% mammals.photos$Ownership) { ## ends at line 60
  
  cat(
   noquote(paste("We used trail cameras to photograph wildlife at the following properties: **", toString(listCamSites), ".", "**\n\n", sep = ""
         )
         )
      )
  
  
}else{ ## ends at line 64
  
  cat("") ## if no cameras, print nothing about cameras!
  
} ## starts at line 60

# Tick species overview
Over the course of our study, we found five tick species across the 16 properties that we surveyed. Here are photos of what the five species look like at different life stages:
```{r tickspecies, out.width = "400px", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
## print the collage of tick species

Here is a summary of the different hosts the tick species feed on in their preferred habitat, geographic range, and the diseases they carry:

# Tick-borne diseases
We tested black-legged ticks for three common tick-borne diseases: Lyme disease, Anaplasmosis, and Babesiosis. We only tested nymph ticks as this is the life stage which most commonly infects humans.

# Diseases found
 __At each of your properties, nymphs tested positive for agents of the following tick-borne diseases:__
```{r detected_disease_table, echo = FALSE}
pathogens.table ## print the table stating which pathogens were present at each site
```

These pie charts show the proportions of ticks tested in each county which were uninfected, infected with a single disease, or coinfected with multiple diseases:
```{r, fig.align = 'center', echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 10}
county_pathogens #and the county averages of pathogens (as pie charts) below it
```

# Wildlife biodiversity
We used trail cameras to survey wildlife at 10 sites in Philadelphia, Delaware, and Chester counties. This information will later be used to analyze relationships between tick-borne diseases and tick hosts, but these photos also provide a record of biodiversity at your property. Over the course of the study, we photographed 16 species across the 10 sites. While we targeted medium- to large-sized mammals, we also photographed some birds and small mammals.

```{r wildlife, fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results='asis', fig.width = 10}

## since there were not cameras used at every site, we need to do an ifelse() for the entire wildlife section
