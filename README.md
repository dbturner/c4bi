This package provides template code and case study code and data to create stakeholder reports for ecological research projects.  Stakeholder reports are individualized summaries of a research project that are given to stakeholders (e.g., homeowners, farmers, land managers) to increase effective communication between researchers and the stakeholders property is sampled.  

We provide a template [R Script](https://github.com/dbturner/c4bi/blob/main/report_code/template/template_rScript.R) and [R Markdown file](https://github.com/dbturner/c4bi/blob/main/report_code/template/template_rmd.Rmd) for users to jumpstart the creation of create their own reports. Reports are generated by paired`.R` Script and `RMarkdown` files that loop through datasets, rendering unique reports for each stakeholder. Please see the [Get Started](https://dbturner.github.io/c4bi/articles/c4bi.html) page for more instructions on using the `c4bi` package. All source code for this project and website can be viewed **[here](https://github.com/dbturner/c4bi)**.


We present two case studies using this method. The first case study is on a project in Cura√ßao where we sampled the biodiversity of home gardens (i.e., yards) across the island. The second case study is on a project in southeastern Pennsylvania where we sampled ground-dwelling invertebrates on small organic farms along the Philadelphia urbanization gradient.  


We recommend users of this package first read [_our publication_](#citation) to understand the conceptual framework behind the project.
