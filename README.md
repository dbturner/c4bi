This package provides code and necessary data to create stakeholder reports based on ecological sampling.  Reports increase effective communication between researchers and the stakeholders whose land is sampled by ecologists. 

Reports are generated by paired `R` and `RMarkdown` scripts that loop through datasets, producing unique and reproducible `HTML` documents. To demonstrate the effectiveness of coding reports in `R` for communication, we present two case studies using this method in the Caribbean island of Cura√ßao for homeowner stakeholders and southeastern Pennsylvania for farmer stakeholders. We also provide a template for users to create their own reports.

We recommend users of this package first read [_our publication_](#citation) to understand the conceptual framework behind the project.
