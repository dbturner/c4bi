This package provides template code and case study code and data to create stakeholder reports for ecological research projects.  Stakeholder reports are individualized summaries of a research project that are given to stakeholders (e.g., homeowners, farmers, land managers) to increase effective communication between researchers and the stakeholders property is sampled.  

We provide [template code](insert link here) for users to create their own reports. Reports are generated by paired`.R` Script and `RMarkdown` files that loop through datasets, rendering unique reports for each stakeholder.


We present two case studies using this method. The [first case study](insert link here) is on a project in Cura√ßao where we sampled the biodiversity of home gardens (i.e., yards) across the island. The second case study is on a project in southeastern Pennsylvania where we sampled ground-dwelling invertebrates on small organic farms along the Philadelphia urbanization gradient.  


We recommend users of this package first read [_our publication_](#citation) to understand the conceptual framework behind the project.
